# Machine Learnign Software Engineer 


## About Treverse
Treverse is a fast‑growing reverse‑logistics company that gives surplus, returned, and over‑stock products a second life through our $1‑start, real‑time bidding platform (a-stock.bid). Every week, thousands of deep‑discount shoppers compete to win inventory that would otherwise end up in landfills. By closing the loop between retailers, wholesalers, and value‑conscious buyers we keep products in use, reduce waste, and unlock new revenue streams for our partners.


Our next chapter is all about AI & machine learning: smarter user experiences, dynamic lot recommender systems, and predictive logistics that make returning, reselling, and redeploying inventory friction‑free.


## The Role

You will be Treverse’s first dedicated ML hire, responsible for designing, prototyping, and productionising models that power core marketplace functions. Reporting directly to the Director of Software Engineering, you’ll have end‑to‑end ownership—from data strategy to model deployment—of a green‑field ML roadmap that touches pricing, recommender systems, demand forecasting, and shipping optimisation.


## What We’re Looking For

### Must‑haves

- 5+ years building and deploying ML models in production (Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, scikit‑learn).
- Proven experience with pricing, recommendation, ranking, or marketplace optimisation algorithms.
- Strong SQL skills and familiarity with modern data‑lake / warehouse patterns (Parquet, Redshift, BigQuery, etc.).
- Ability to own the full MLOps lifecycle: CI/CD, feature stores, monitoring, and model retraining pipelines (Docker, AWS, SageMaker, Vertex AI, or similar).
- Comfortable in a fast‑moving, ambiguous startup environment; can translate business KPIs into technical roadmaps.
Nice‑to‑haves

- Background in reverse‑logistics, e‑commerce, or supply‑chain analytics.
- Familiarity with serverless architectures (Lambda, Step Functions) and event‑driven micro‑services.
- Experience applying reinforcement learning or bandit algorithms to pricing or allocation problems.
- Passion for the circular economy and sustainability metrics.


### Our Tech Stack
- Backend – Go & Node.js micro‑services on AWS (Fargate, Lambda, API Gateway).
D- ata – Event‑driven streams (Kafka), S3 data lake, Redshift warehouse, dbt transformations.
- MLOps – Terraform, EKS, MLflow/Feast, SageMaker Pipelines (open to alternatives you champion).
Frontend – React + TypeScript.


### Why Treverse
- Green‑field ML charter – Define the architecture, choose the tooling, and hire the future team.
- Mission with impact – Every model you ship keeps usable goods out of landfills and in the hands of budget‑conscious families.
- Visible results – Changes you deploy today appear in this week’s live bidding events and our customer community.
- Full on-site –Just outside of Nashville, TN HQ
